# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpreted user needs by communicating with the client and the potential end user on how the product should work and how they intend to interact with the product. When developing the product, I kept in mind that the product needs to be very intuitive and simple while still meeting the requirments set by the client. The user stories help with understanding the requirments so that they can be turned into tasks placed on the product backlog.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by first thinking about the steps I can break down the product into. I hope to incorporate a version of story points into my future development work. I think it will help me better estimate how long and how much effort an entire product will take.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means knowing your role and playing your role. It also means communicating well and collaborating.
